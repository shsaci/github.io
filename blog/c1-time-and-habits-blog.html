      <ul>
        <li id = "q">Timebox and habit techniques I tried:</li>
        I read through almost all of them, and also watched one of the two videos. I have tried meditation and mindfulness techniques in the recent past. I found the talk 'Fogg method' enlightening. And so was the article on 'successful people start small'.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li id = "q">What I found interesting:</li>
        The articles on meditation techniques, research and mindfulness were very convincing. I especially liked the description of various parts of the brain, what they do and how they are impacted by quietening the mind I had read about the pomodoro technique before I started my course here and agree with its simple but affective principle.

      </ul>

        <li id = "q">Things that worked for me:</li>
        Meditation and mindfulness techniques have worked for me in the recent past. I tried the fogg method last night and that was good. As the person said habits take no motivation but they take time to develop. After I read about the Pomodoro technique I realised that I had been applying it in my life already -admittedly not limited myself to twenty-five minutes. I usually get myself to work for about 35-40 mins to 'get the juices going'. And then I usually get too involved to stop.
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li id = "q">I intend to experiment further with:</li>
        I intend to continue being regular with the meditation and mindfulness techniques. I have also gone ahead and added two apps - one of which was mentioned in the articles. I will also continue to apply the method of 'adding a tiny habit'. The pomodoro technique warrants continued use even if I use a hacked limit of forty minutes. Being comfortable with starting small would also add more contentment to my life.
