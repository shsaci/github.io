      <ul>
        <li id = "q">Timebox and habit techniques I tried:</li>
            I read through almost all of them, and also watched one of the two videos. I have tried meditation <br>
            and mindfulness techniques in the recent past. I found the talk 'Fogg method' enlightening. And so was<br>
            the article on 'successful people start small'.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
      <li id = "q">What I found interesting:</li>
          The articles on meditation techniques, research and mindfulness were very convincing. I especially liked<br>
          the description of various parts of the brain, what they do and how they are impacted by quietening the mind <br>
          I had read about the pomodoro technique before I started my course here and agree with its simple but affective<br>
          principle.

      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
      <li id = "q">Things that worked for me:</li>
          Meditation and mindfulness techniques have worked for me in the recent past. I tried the fogg method last night<br>
          and that was good. As the person said habits take no motivation but they take time to develop. After I read about<br>
          the Pomodoro technique I realised that I had been applying it in my life already -admittedly not limited myself to <br>
          twenty-five minutes. I usually get myself to work for about 35-40 mins to 'get the juices going'. And then I usually <br>
          get too involved to stop.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
      <li id = "q">I intend to experiment further with:</li>
          I intend to continue being regular with the meditation and mindfulness techniques. I have also gone ahead and added two <br>
          apps - one of which was mentioned in the articles. I will also continue to apply the method of 'adding a tiny habit'. The<br>
          pomodoro technique warrants continued use even if I use a hacked limit of forty minutes. Being comfortable with starting <br>
          small would also add more contentment to my life.
      </ul>
