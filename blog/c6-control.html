    <h2>C6 Self Regulation</h2>
    <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></p>
    <p>The author described the theme of the chapter as 'from compulsion to choice'. Self Regulation consists of five emotional traits: Self-Control, Trustworthiness, Conscientiousness, Adaptability & Innovation. The ability to be in charge of one's reactions is to display choice. I like how they shared that the rising of a particular emotion in one's mind, including the physiological reaction cannot be stopped, but a trained mind lets go of the emotion, leaving one with a choice to react the way one chooses to.</p>
    <p>Feeling bad about feeling bad is a reflection of the ego's image of itself. Meta distress is bad economics, whilst letting (emotional) monsters go hungry is good economics. The attentional focus to cognitive change is also a enlightening way to put things.</p>

    <p><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness</strong></p>
    <p>This chapter involved a 10 minute exercise including mindfulness. I will comment on that The mnemonic felt a bit odd, but I was surprised how well the Siberian North Rail Road process works. I had a recent situation I could conveniently think of, I watched the video and read the chapter. The chapter has detailed instructions which I followd and the exercise worked remarkably well.</p>
