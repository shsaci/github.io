    <h2>C6 Self Regulation</h2>
    <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></p>
    <p>The author described the theme of the chapter as 'from compulsion to choice'. Self Regulation consists of five emotional traits: Self-Control, Trustworthiness, Conscientiousness, Adaptability & Innovation. The ability to be in charge of one's reactions is to display choice. I like how they shared that the rising of a particular emotion in one's mind, including the physiological reaction cannot be stopped, but a trained mind lets go of the emotion, leaving one with a choice to react the way one chooses to.</p>

    <p><strong>Try atleast one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </strong></p>
    <p>I did both body scan and journaling. The body scan was deceptively relaxing. And it does lead to being more in touch with oneself. Journalling was an interesting technique and the research around it, per the book, is mind blowing. Journalling usually makes me feel more 'congruent', that is the best word I can choose. And it did the same today :)</p>

    <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></p>
    <p>I agreed with what they stated about emotions being fleeting if one doesn't fuel the emotion, whether it be positive or negative. And I also like the 'floating clouds in the sky' analogy they used.</p>
