    <h2>C2 Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <p><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></p>
    <p>First off its great that EDA is 'getting us' to read this book! Emotional Intelligence consists of five components:
      <ol>
        <li>Self Awareness</li>
        <li>Self Regulation</li>
        <li>Motivation</li>
        <li>Empathy</li>
        <li>Social Skills</li>
      </ol>
      High emotional intelligence is associated with stellar work performance, outstanding leadership and ability to create conditions
      for happiness. On the personal side, higher emotional intelligence can lead to persistent 'side-effects' like happiness, resilience, optimism and kindness.

    <p>Sections on training attention, bringing mindfulness to the body, neuroplasticity and neuroimaging therapy contain new-to-me, 'mind blowing' information. All the scientific helps the logical part of me buy into mindfulness techniques.</p>

    <p><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></p>
    <p>Mindfulness clarifies my mind. As was mentioned with the snowglobe analogy, once the agitation stops it returns to its default state of calmness and tranquil.</p>
