    <h2>T3 Design to Web Blog</h2>
    <p><strong>What a responsive site is and why responsiveness is important?</strong></p>
    <p>A responsive site automatically molds itself to the screen size it is requested on,sometimes varying content placement and display greatly, to enhance user experience.</p>

    <p><strong>What mobile first design is and why it is important?</strong></p>
    <p>An increasing number of people use mobile devices to access the internet. If a site is built as desktop-first, there can be an almost infinite number of small screen sizes to cater to, but if a site is designed as mobile first, then content can be varied easier with expanding screen sizes. <br>  Using the above approach allows for smaller, and probably 'weaker', devices to not have to parse through large amounts of code. Desktops might generally be a lot more capable of handling more code when loading a website.</p>

    <p><strong>What are frameworks, and what are pros/cons?</strong></p>
    <p>A framework is a standardized package, usually consisting of html, css, javascript etc, and is helpful when first setting up a website. It cuts down on a lot of basic work. <br>  Amongst positive points are compatibility enhancements on browsers, fixes to common css issues, allow clean and tidy coding, and a common solution set to solve problems in a team-project.<br>  Amongst commonly considered downsides is the unused code left over that loads with every website wether its required or not, and a slower learning curve in web development, since one can rely on the framework to do a lot of work, instead of having to deal with the nitty-gritty oneself.</p>

    <p><strong>What a wireframe is and why it is used?</strong></p>
    <p>Basic representation of different/major parts of a web page. <br>  A wireframe helps establish what information is most important and where it should be places on a web page. If following the 'F' pattern, the important points including any 'call to action' banners or buttons should be on the upper left of the web page.<br>  Another benefit of wireframes is it can be used to communicate the basic design of the webpage to others. A wireframe can also be used as a blue print to compare the webpage design to, during the development process.</p>

    <p><strong>Aspects of wireframe I found challenging to implement and why?</strong></p>
    <p>In an ideal world I assume a developer would be able to take any idea presented and covert it into a working webpage. Because it was my first time wireframing, and also one of my first times developing the page, I had to go back and decide that one of the 'mobile' wireframes I had done was not feasible.<br> It was quite disconnected from the 'desktop' version and looked like it would require extra plugins and javascript, animation etc to come to life. So I deleted that wireframe and built it more compatible with my desktop site.</p>
