    <h2>HTML-CSS-DOM-p1</h2>
        <p><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></p>
            <p>HTML files are like the skeleton or structure details. In a house they would define: placement of walls, floors, doors, windows etc. CSS defines style of the HTML elements including color, size, background etc. DOM is an amalgamation of HTML and CSS to form a complete structure of the web-page.</p>

      <p><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></p>
          <p>Everything on a website is a box. Boxifying a design is akin to simplifying it so as to be able to understand, replicate or modify it. In a literal sense it can be useful to draw boxes around website elements, to understand them, by printing it out and using a pencil.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the box model?</strong></p>
          <p>Box model is used to represent each element on a webpage. It consists of margin, border, padding and content. The box model can be especially useful in understanding the true size of the element (content width + margins + borders)</p>
