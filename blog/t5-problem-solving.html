    <h2>T5 Problem Solving</h2>
    <p><strong>A situation where I got blocked on a simple issue?</strong></p>
    <p>I was having a fair amount of trouble following the instructions on CodeAcademy Beginner JS tutorials last week. Part of me knew the instructions were rather simple, but for some reason I was having to read everything three times before I could successfully go through the exercise.<br>
       I learned that it's better to take a nap when one is that tired versus trying to force oneself to plough on anyway :D</p>

    <p><strong>A situation where I solved a problem in an elegant manner.</strong></p>
    <p>During one of the freecode camp exercises, I decided to write psuedocode before starting on any prgramming because it required multiple levels of understanding and I wasn't sure I'd be able to write code straight-away. The psuedo coding helped break down the problem into small steps, and then I could just focus on writing code one step-at-a-time.<br> I learned how important psuedo-coding and planning can be before starting to develop the webiste/ write a program.</p>

    <p><strong>My confidence level in using the following problem solving techniques and processes:</strong></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Pseudocode: I have used pseudocoding a few times now, and I feel comfortable with the process. I think as I keep on using it more I will also collect more information on how others psuedocode, and learn from best practices. </li>
      <li>Trying something: I intellectually understand the power of trying something and many a success have come from just attempting to solve a challenge. It can be easy to feel stuck/frozen when learning something new but using pseudocode as first and 'trying something' as second step, can be very useful.</li>
      <li>Rubber ducky method: To use this method literally, would probably only happen if I was extremely desperate, but I have known myself to use brief walks whilst the brain busily resolves various aspects of a programming challenge. That has been helpful to me, and I assume thats my iteration of the 'rubber ducky method'.</li>
      <li>Reading Error Messages: For the most part I am ok with deciphering error messages, even when/if I end up asking google what it might mean. Sometimes a message looks long or complex but I get me to re-read it and pick up any familiar parts such as function names, line numbers, file names etc.  </li>
      <li>Console Logging: Console logging can be very useful as an incremental way of building up one's program. It is one of the most useful techniques I have found, and I use it often.</li>
      <li>Googling: I do use google to search for answers to general concepts, applications and queries. When searching I try and summarize what I am looking for. Being too specific can be detrimental and maybe vice versa as well.</li>
      <li>Asking peers for help: There is a sense of satisfaction from being able to do something yourself, and that can be an impediment to reaching out to others for help. I won't say I never have this challenge myself, but I try and minimize anything that may prevent me from asking for help from my peers.</li>
      <li>Asking coaches for help: In the past, this has been slightly more difficult for me than asking peers for help; maybe I think coaches might be too busy helping others or I might not get a response quick enough anyway - meaning I should keep trying myself. I haven't been in this situation yet, in this course. And I will make myself ask the coaches were such a situation to arise, just to break out of old habits.</li>
      <li>Improving process with reflection: Apart from the reflection(s) we do as part of this course, I don't usually do proactive reflection. It may feel I have already learnt from the positive and negative outcomes and approaches, and hence I don't need to write it down. I do find reflecting, as part of this course, useful, but I am still in two minds if I need to do it for anything else.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><strong>Explain what .map(), .filter() & .reduce() functions do.</strong></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>map(): map() method creates a new array with the outcome of calling a function on every element of the original array. The original array remains unchanged.</li>
      <li>filter(): filter() method creates a new array for all elements of the original array on which the provided function returns a true value. The original array remains unchanged.</li>
      <li>reduce(): the reduce() method can be used to reduce an array to a single value via executing a provided function for each value of the array left-to-right.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
