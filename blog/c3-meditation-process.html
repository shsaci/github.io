    <h2>C3 Meditation Process</h2>

    <p><strong>How did process-over-product concept affect my web site building task?</strong></p>
    <p>I did pay more attention to why I was doing what I was doing and a greater focus on understanding how everything connects vs. trying to hack a solution to get a working website up as soon as possible. Also allowed myself to go into 'shallow rabit holes' experimenting with a few concepts and techniques and seeing how they turn out when connected together, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2? </strong></p>
    <p>Meditation sounded like a skill that one has or has not. Either you are an insider or an outsider. But I like how they mention in the video that through practice anyone can access the technique of meditation. Ofcourse the more one practices the better one might become.</p>

    <p><strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong></p>
    <p>Meditation is nothing but practice. In other traditions meditation has synonyms such as 'Bhavana'/Cultivation & 'becoming aware'. Concentration is using meta-attention to focus attention. With concentration the mind can be allowed to settle leading to its default state of clarity, happiness and joy. Happy is thus something one allows not achieves. In meditation and exercise, the first week is easy, but long lasting results and fulfillment involves persisting past the first week.<br>
    Whilst one might want to follow the traditional standard meditation posture, in reality the best posture is whatever allows alertness and relaxation to occur at the same time.</p>

    <p><strong>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you? </strong></p>
    <p>Currently focussed concentration techniques suit me better.</p>
