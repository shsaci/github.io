    <h2>C7 Motivation</h2>
    <p><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></p>
    <p>Pleasure: This is usually the shortest lived, unsustaninable type of happiness. It only lasts as long as the stimulus lasts.</p>
    <p>Passion: This is more sustainable than 'pleasure', and is sometimes described as 'flow'. Flow is best created when the degree of difficulty is high enough to challenge the person but not so high that it overwhelms them.</p>
    <p>Higher Purpose: This type of happiness is the longest lasting, especially if it has an altruistic intention. It can also have a flow-on effect. As we get better at doing work that originates from our higher purpose we get into the 'flow' more often, and since we become good at it, and enter the state of flow often, it may allow us to experience pleasure at certain times as well.</p>

    <p><strong>What are your core values, and what do you stand for?</strong></p>
    <p>My core values heavily steer towards growth and contribution in that order. I like leraning abd bettering myself, and I also like to provide a benefit to others from my learning, knowledge and effort.</p>
    <p>I stand for high integrity, alignment with my higher purpose, helping/giving to others, growth and achievement.</p>

    <p><strong>How were the resilience ideas and meditation exercises?</strong></p>
    <p>The resilience ideas were great because they broke down the principle into inner calm, emotional resilience and cognitive resilience. I liked the emotional reslience meditation. I think if it was done often/ popularized, it would free people from the shackles of 'fear-of-failure' or 'grasping-for-success'. </p>
