        <p><strong>What is grid based design?</strong></p>
            <p>Most webpages, if not all follow a grid  structure. CSS makes it easy to setup a grid. A lot of times setting up css classes to cover 12 rows can make it entirely sufficient to design a complete website, simply by altering what row the element is placed at and controlling the width via the number of columns it spans.</p>

      <p><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong></p>
          <p>Given the large number of devices being used to access the internet, it is imperative that a website be able to auto adjust for the best user experience. Using design features including @mediaquery make it easier to make a webpage 'responsive' to the screen size it is being accessed on.</p>

      <p><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></p>
          <p>Semantic structure tells the browser about the type of elements but also makes common sense to any user viewing the code. Example h1 is the most prominent heading on a page but also clear that it is so to anyone reading the html/ css code</p>

      <p><strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</strong></p>
      <p>I think this had some very important concepts about making the screen suitable for various devices including users using thumbs instead of a mouse etc. I also liked them explaining the 12 col system. They didn't go into as much detail about @mediaquery as I would have like them to, but maybe that will become clearer in later lessons.</p>
