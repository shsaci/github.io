    <h2>T4 Javascript Basics</h2>
    <p><strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></p>
    <p>HTML is used to setup the structure of a webpage. CSS can be used to 'decorate' the page, including some animations. Javascript can be seen to be an extension to html. It can be used to dynamically update content on a website.</p>

    <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong></p>
    <p>Loops define repitition, and daily activities like waking up and brushing can be considered repititious. There is a level of subconscious flow-control involved because we have 'break/check-points' to make sure activities flow smoothly, and in the proper order e.g. open door first, before walking through, apply paste to brush before choosing to brush teeth.</p>

    <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</strong></p>
    <p>Data can be accessed from arrays using numeric index positions, even for nested array situations. Accessing data from object literals is slightly different - being akin to getting the value using 'keys'. The object literals have a property:value system.</p>

    <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></p>
    <p>Functions help follow the DRY principle in software programming. It is convenient to be able to name a set of code as a function and invoke/call the function instead of having to write the same set of code multiple times in a program.
