    <p><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></p>
    <p>This week, I couldn't try these one-on-one with anyone, but I did have social situations where I practiced what I had learnt about 'giving people the benefit of the doubt', and using the original version of the kindness meditation. More than anything, practicing the above, kept me happy.</p>

    <p><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></p>
    <p>Again, couldn't try these with someone else one-on-one, but I like the difference between mindful listening and empathic listening, and it would be nice to try it the next time I am having a conversation with someone.</p>

    <p><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></p>
    <p>I think it's common sense once one learns about it. I think 'why wouldn't someone do this'. Especially the first part where one is just choosing to focus on kindness and wellbeing.</p>

    <p><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></p>
    <p>Case 1: If I were 100% correct: I was speaking to someone and they stated their insurance rates had gone up without adequate notice or advice via their policy document wordings. This is despite them confirming they were in posession of the annual premium increase notice which was sent more than a month before actual increase, and also in posession of the policy document which also mentioned premium increases. </p>
    <p>Case 2: If the other person/ people were 100% correct: They were calling to complain that their premium had increased by a great amount than usual. Even though the same amount of notice had been provided to them every year, the increase was greater this year because of a 10 year adjustment. Although the policy wordings state a manual adjustment every 10 years, they didn't think it was upto them to read all that it said in the policy wordings. </p>
