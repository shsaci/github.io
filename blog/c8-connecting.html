    <h2>C8 Connecting</h2>
    <p><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></p>
    <p>This week, I couldn't try these one-on-one with anyone, but I did have social situations where I practiced what I had learnt about 'giving people the benefit of the doubt', and using the original version of the kindness meditation. More than anything, practicing the above, kept me happy.</p>

    <p><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></p>
    <p>Again, couldn't try these with someone else one-on-one, but I like the difference between mindful listening and empathic listening, and it would be nice to try it the next time I am having a conversation with someone.</p>

    <p><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></p>
    <p>I think it's common sense once one learns about it. I think 'why wouldn't someone do this'. Especially the first part where one is just choosing to focus on kindness and wellbeing.</p>

    <p><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></p>
    <p>Case 1: If I were 100% correct:  </p>
    <p>Case 2: If the other person/ people were 100% correct:  </p>
