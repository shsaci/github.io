    <h2>T6 Javascript Language</h2>
    <p><strong>In the JavaScript language describe all the use cases for each of the follwing:</strong></p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>parenthesis()
          <ol>
            <li>
              Define a function e.g. function f (parameter 1, parameter 2) {}
            </li>
            <li>
              Prioritizing expression calculations e.g. (a + b) + c
            </li>
            <li>
              Containing expressions e.g. if (a < b) {}
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          brackets[]: brackets are mainly used in relation to arrays. e.g. to declare an aray 'arr' one would say, var arr = [5]; Brackets can also be used to access or delete object properties e.g. delete object1[property], assuming property:value pairing in the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          braces {}: Braces are usually used to enclose conditional statements or function bodies e.g. function func() {} Braces are also used for defining objects e.g. var object1 = {prop1: val1, prop2: val2}
        </li>
        <li>
          single quotes ' ': Traditionally, in other mainstream languages single quotes are used for characters, but in javascript single quotes can be used for strings as well.<br>
            On a side note, proponents of using single quotes in JS mention using less keystrokes (vs. double quotes) = more productivity, and single quotes reduce the total number of characters, which results in less bandwidth usage! :)
        </li>
        <li>
          double quotes " ": Double quotes in mainstream programming languages refers to strings. Another benefit of using double quotes is one doesn't have to espace single quotes in a stream of text e.g. "I'm a little tea-pot" vs 'I\'m a little tea-pot'
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
