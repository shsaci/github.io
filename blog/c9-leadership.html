    <h2>C9 Leadership</h2>
    <p><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></p>
    <p>Having been working for more than ten years, and had many managers, the insight about employees valuing 'affection - expressed and wanted' really hit home. It suddenly became clear why certain managers produced better results from the team than others.</p>

    <p><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>
    <p>Multiplying goodness is a very powerful technique. It worked very well. I felt very calm, happy and centred as a side-affect.</p>

    <p><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>
    <p>This technique didn't suit me. The fact that it involves attracting in suffering and filtering it, felt very awkward. I couldn't go through with the proess completely.</p>

    <p><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></p>
    <p>SCARF:<ul>
      <li>Status: I have believed, for a while, that immature systems promote competition amongst it's own members, and then go to great lengths to recognize the 'victors'. I think this artificial enhacing of certain member's status(s) is not good long-term, for the group culture. The fact that a lot of the world seems to operate this way doesn't make it right, in my opinion. I haven't experienced systems like these at EDA in phase 0. Maybe this is deliberate, maybe coincidental.</li>
      <li>Certainty: Giving up a career where one is considered an 'expert', and one where one feels certain of success, given past results - this move obviously incites lack of certainty, but the work we have done on mindfulness and self awareness techniques helps. Also - knowing one's personal goals and motivations keeps one going regardless of lack of 100% certainty. </li>
      <li>Autonomy: The feelings around autonomy has been very important for me to realise. I realised them a few weeks ago - when I am excited about working in an area, even long hours cause a minimal amount of stress. On the other hand if I feel something is being imposed on me, long-term, then, as the book mentions, feelings of helplessness, stress and stress related conditions crop up. </li>
      <li>Relatedness: I believe it is important to establish common ground and goals with people on your team. Doesn't everyone needs to be one's 'best friend', but enough to know that we are all working towards common self and group goals. </li>
      <li>Fairness: Fairness, or people acting to rectify perceived unfairness, as described in the book sounds like 'revenge'. I personally haven't had that feeling come up during phase 0. In the past when this feeling has come up, I remind myself 'what one resists, persists'. I choose to fortify my efforts in the areas I want to focus on, regardless of wether someone else is supposedly being fair/unfair towards me. </li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? </strong></p>
    <p>I couldn't find a topic to have a difficult conversation this week/end. In the past, I have followed a similar system to the one recommended in the book, though not in sequence:
      <ul>
        <li>A little bit of perspective and humilty goes a fair way. It is usually (unfortunately) quite true that what we accuse someone of, might have been done by ourselves some time or the other, even if we do not do 'that thing' anymore. Asking oneself the three questions, as mentioned in the course/book are a good way to start. </li>
        <li>In my personal experience over the past many years, just the first step (above) is enough to make me reconsider raising the issue in a lot of situations. At this point one can move to compassion and understanding which the book mentions as one of the final steps in 'partnering and problem solving'. </li>
        <li>The 'perspective' part I mentioned in the first step has been easier for me when I 'bounce' the situation off of someone I trust. More often that not, they offer reflections and suggestions that go a long way to help me understand the bigger picture easier. This is what I think the book mentions as 'objective 3rd person story' </li>
        <li>Explore each other's point of view: As the course mentions, a lot of time other people's intention is not the same as the impact their actions/behaviour might have on one-self. Talking to the other party about their point of view and perspective can be very informational. </li>
        <li>Partner and problem solve: Come up with solutions that meet both parties most important criterion and setup ways to keep the communication open in the future. </li>
      </ul>
     </p>
