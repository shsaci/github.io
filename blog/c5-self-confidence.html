    <h2>C5 Self Confidence</h2>
    <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></p>
    <p>Mindfulness practiced allows higher aware of emotions that one might be feeling at the time. This higher awareness of feelings leads to more accurate self assessment of one's strengths and weaknesses. A better understanding of self leads to higher confidence in one's abilities.</p>

    <p><strong>Try atleast one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </strong></p>
    <p>I did both body scan and journaling. The body scan was deceptively relaxing. And it does lead to being more in touch with oneself. Journalling was an interesting technique and the research around it, per the book, is mind blowing. Journalling usually makes me feel more 'congruent', that is the best word I can choose. And it did the same today :)</p>

    <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></p>
    <p>I agreed with what they stated about emotions being fleeting if one doesn't fuel the emotion, whether it be positive or negative. And I also like the 'floating clouds in the sky' analogy they used.</p>
