    <h1>c1 Reflection Blog</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
            Based on what I have heard, read and watched (fireside chat video), I am excited <br>
            about the opportunity to learn in a non-traditional learning environment.<br>
            I like the self-taking responsibility part.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>What are your impressions?</li>
          I have been in this environment (phase 0) for about 3 days at present, and I understand how more <br>
          work might make one feel under-pressure. So far some things have been challenging, but as someone said<br>
          about writing software: "95% of the time it won't work". The sense of achievement comes from the <br>
          finished product, and the incremental steps in getting there.

      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
          I am liking the sharing and supportive nature of other people. I have also tried to help others <br>
          out when I can. I have already learnt many new 'tricks' in various areas as a result. In my 'current <br>
          life' people ask me questions a lot of times, and I feel good in helping them. Even though software <br>
          development is new to me, I would like to carry through my streak of 'wanting to contribute' to <br>
          the EDA environment as much as possible.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
          If Shereef's video is anything to go by, I would definitely want to do my best. He talks about getting <br>
          as much out of this as one puts in; which is a very good comment. I'm usually 'independently-creative' <br>
          so asking for help can be difficult for me, but on the other hand I will implement my brand of self- <br>
          responsibility, creativity & independence in the most productive way possible.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
          I am excited about being able to participate in this non-traditional environment of learning. I have heard <br>
          only positive feedback about this type of a setup, and wish to do my best at working hard, accepting information<br>
          about new-to-me technology, and processes, and making the most from this experience. Of-course there is an <br>
          element of nervousness that comes into play, but I guess it also helps keep one's faculties sharp haha. Choose <br>
          courage over comfort, as they say.
      </ul>
    </p>
