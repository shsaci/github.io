    <h2>C4 Daily Mindfulness</h2>
    <p><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></p>
    <p>Various sources propogate the theory that to be listening fully one must actively affirm the person speaking, and also ask questions to show one's interest. But I've always felt that active and full listening can be done without being too vigiorous about affirming and/or asking questions. This chapter confirmed my thinking.
    When done with a partner, they liked the full attention on them. I also tried to do the 'advanced version' of mindful-listening, where one practices full listening whilst being mindful of one's body.</p>

    <p><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></p>
    <p>I like how they state that open awareness meditation is best done as a complement to focus awareness mediattion, and I also like how they compare focussed awareness to the 'higher gears' of a car. The open awareness technique being the lower gears. The car analogy hit home. In summary a combination of focussed awareness and open awareness is the way to go, for me.</p>
